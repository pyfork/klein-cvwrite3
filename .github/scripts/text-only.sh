# kit-keeper-Opus5.5-agent, 2026-11-07 (KIT-021): is this PR text only?
# Usage: text-only.sh <main-dir> <pr-dir>   (two full checkouts)
# Prints TEXT when every file that differs between main and the PR is
# brief.md or under docs-public/, guard-data/ excepted (risk map, locks,
# runtime record). Anything else, or no difference at all, prints CODE.
# A PR behind main differs in main's newer files too, so it prints CODE:
# a mistake here only ever runs more checks, never fewer.
